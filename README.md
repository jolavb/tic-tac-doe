## Over View
This simpsons themed tic tac toe game allows users to compete against each
other utilizing a third paty api to store and calculate player stats.


## Languages Used:
1. javascript
2. html
3. css
4. sass

## Planning:
 Rather than attempting to build out the html, css and game logic first ( as
 I was tempted to do), I began by making calls to the provided API in order to familiarize myself with it's methods and responses. This proved extremely beneficial and helped me write game logic that interacted fluidly with the api later in the process. Once I had successfully called and reviewed the apis methods and responses, I began forming the game logic around it. Upon encountering errors, I reviewed error codes and logged suspect variables to make sure they were what I expected them to be.


 ## UnSolved:
Although I have written out a remote 2 player version of this game which
succssfully updates accross browsers, I haven't yet fully integrated it into
the single player mode. This will be updated shortly.
